    What is a class selector in CSS? In CSS, a class selector is formatted as a period (.) character followed by the name of the class. It selects all elements with that class attribute so that unique 
    CSS declarations can be applied to those specific elements, without affecting other elements on the page</p>

    ID Selectors</h2>
    <p Id="cyan">The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element! 
    To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
    Instead of class attribute we can use ID attribute in css</p>
